# Furniture Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based, collaborative filtering, and style-based approaches to provide personalized furniture recommendations.

## Overview

This system provides three types of recommendations:
1. Content-based recommendations (similar items)
2. Collaborative filtering recommendations (user-based)
3. Hybrid recommendations (combining both approaches with style matching)
